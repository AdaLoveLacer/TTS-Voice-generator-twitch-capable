# Deprecated: prefer `requirements.txt`.
#
# This file was originally created as a helper to install CUDA-enabled PyTorch
# wheels. The project's `requirements.txt` now contains the `--extra-index-url`
# entry so you can install GPU builds by simply running:
#
#   py -3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --prefer-binary

# If you prefer a separate file for GPU-specific installs, re-create this file
# with the PyTorch extra index, otherwise ignore it.
